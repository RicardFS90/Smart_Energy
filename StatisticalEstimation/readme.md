# Statistical Estimation

*Statistical inference* deals with understanding the quality of parameter estimates of a sample.

Statistical inference produces statistical propositions about:

+ point estimates (a particular value that best approximates some parameter of interest),
+ confidence intervals (or set estimates) or
+ the rejection of a hypothesis.


Statistical inference is based on assumptions related to a statistical model or sampling process. Correct inference requires these assumptions to be correct.

In this session we will develop the frequentist inference paradigm. It bases the production of propositions by considering repeated sampling of a population. P-values and confidence intervals are its most common propositions.
